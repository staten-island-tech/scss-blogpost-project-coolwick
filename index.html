            <h1 class="title3">I Watch People Eat</h1>
            <h2 class="text3">Do you watch mukbangs? It was originated in Japan meaning "eating show" you just literally watch people eat. Some people find it weird like ASMR and stuff but I kind of enjoy it. The thing is I dont even do it on purpose. I think it is becuase I wish I could eat all those bad  but tasty food myself. It would pop up on my feed and the next thing you know I watched someone eat for 15 minutes. Damn the internet really takes your life away sometimes.</h2>

            <h1 class="title2">You Ever Just Look At A Person And Just...</h1>
            <h2 class="text3">You ever just look at a person and just think what the...? You ever wonder what their lives are like? It's so easy to judge people at first because its human nature. How can that everyone is unique in their own way yet we are all the same. I read this thing where you can literally fall in love with anything if you get to know them well enough, an that made me think how meeting people is so crazy. You can literally end up making a long lasting connection with someone just by taking something lightly, or joking in a specific way.</h2>

            <h1 class="title1">How I feel About Senior Year Being Canceled</h1>
            <h2 class="text1">It kinda sucks. But when I think about it more, it is kind of cool. I am having fun in my own way anyway. Although we miss out on a lot of acitivites, it gives me more time to focus on college stuff and my own mental health without FOMO. I am just hoping that we will have more senior activities as spring/summer rolls around. Being in school is fun though, it's a nice change of pace from staying home all the time.  </h2>
